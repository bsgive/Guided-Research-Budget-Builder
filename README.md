IMPORTANT NOTE: To access administrative mode, the user must log in as the administrator. To do that, they must enter the email as "admin@gmail.com" and the password as "admin". If the user wishes to change that, then they will need to reset the users database and create the first user as whoever they want to have control of the administrative mode.
